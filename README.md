# Audio-Denoising-System
Advanced audio denoising system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture and a ResNet101 backbone. This system effectively removes background noises from audio recordings, preserving the integrity of the original signal. It features a user-friendly GUI built with customtkinter for recording, uploading, denoising, and playing audio, integrated with a server-based backend for processing

## Key Features
- Audio Recording and Upload: Capture audio via microphone or upload files.
- Denoising: Process audio using a pretrained U-Net model to remove noise.
- Playback: Compare original and denoised audio with seamless playback controls.
- Visualization: Display waveforms and spectrograms for both original and denoised audio.
- Save Functionality: Export denoised audio.
- Client-Server Architecture: Scalable backend for denoising with a TCP socket-based server.
- Multi-Threaded Processing: Efficient handling of recording, playback, and denoising tasks.

## Model Training

The model was trained on the LibriSpeech Noise Dataset with the following configuration:

- Architecture: U-Net with ResNet101 backbone, pretrained on ImageNet.
- Input: Log-magnitude spectrograms (544x320x1).
- Preprocessing: Audio chunking, STFT, normalization, and padding
- Training: 100 epochs, batch size 6, Adam optimizer (lr=0.0001), MSE loss.
  
The training achieved a validation loss of 0.0083, indicating strong denoising performance
